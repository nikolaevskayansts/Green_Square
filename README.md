# GREEN SQUARE

## Installation that combines a website and an app connected through Firebase. 

#### Suddenly, I don’t have any materials left from the exhibition, so here I demonstrate the installation using a computer.

#### The task was to create the media allowing gallery visitors to decide directly what content should be in the context of contemporary art. I realized this by using self-written website accepting the user’s image and app displaying last uploaded image on the gallery wall.
#### This work was exhibited at the local gallery of modern art "Kunsthalle Number 7"
